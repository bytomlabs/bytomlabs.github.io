## BIMP

Bytom Improvement Proposals (BMIPs) describe standards for the Bytom platform, including core protocol, client APIs, VM specifications and contract standards. Having a BMIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.<br />Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Bytom users.<br />Review [BMIP-001](https://github.com/Bytom/bmips/blob/master/bmip-001.mediawiki) and follow the instructions to submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/bytom/bmip/pulls) to this repository.
