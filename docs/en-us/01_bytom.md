## Introduction of Bytom Blockchain

Bytom Blockchain Protocol (abbreviated simply as
Bytom) is an interactive protocol of multiple byte assets. Heterogeneous
byte-assets (indigenous digital currency, digital assets) that operate in
different forms on the Bytom Blockchain and atomic assets (warrants,
securities, dividends, bonds, intelligence information, forecasting information
and so forth that exist in the physical world) can be registered, exchanged,
gambled and engaged in other more complicated and contract-based
interoperations via Bytom. Bytom endeavors to bridge the atomic world and the
byte world, promoting the interaction of assets between the two worlds, with
the mission of creating diverse assets and a programmable economy.
