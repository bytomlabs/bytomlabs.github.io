## Overview

Bytom Blockchain Protocol (hereinafter referred as Bytom) is an interactive protocol of multiple byteassets. Heterogeneous byte-assets (indigenous digital currency, digital assets) that operate in different forms on the Bytom Blockchain and atomic assets (warrants, securities, dividends, bonds, intelligence information, forecasting information and other information that exist in the physical world) can be registered, exchanged, gambled and engaged in other more complicated and contract-based interoperations via Bytom. The protocol connects the atomic world and the byteworld to promote the interaction and circulation of assets between the two worlds.

## Feature

- Compatible with the UTXO
- General address format
- Compatible with National Encryption Standard
- POW algorithm that is friendly to AI ASIC-chips
- Asset naming using ODIN
- Separate transaction signatures from the rest of the data in a transaction
- Enhanced trading flexibility
- Cross-chain asset dividends distribution through side-chain

## Document Description

This document is used to guide developers to understand Bytom technology and develop in Bytom Blockchain..

This document will introduce the technical details and development methods of the Bytom blockchain from the simple construction of the node to the technical principle analysis, and then to the contract introduction.
