## What is Bytom SPV Wallet?
SPV wallet verifies that a transaction is included in the Bytom blockchain, without downloading the entire blockchain. The SPV wallet only needs to download the block headers, which are much smaller than the full blocks. To verify that a transaction is in a block, SPV wallet requests a proof of inclusion, in the form of a Merkle branch.<br />In the current state `bytom spv wallet` is able to:
* Manage key, account as well as asset
* Send transactions, i.e., issue, spend and retire asset

There are three options for the flag `--chain_id`:
