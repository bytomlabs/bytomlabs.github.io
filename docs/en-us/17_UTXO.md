# UTXO

​	The full name of UTXO is ”Unspend transaction output“. On the Bytom Blockchain, every input of each transaction  (except issue, coinbase) will spend a UTXO, and every output of each transaction (except retire) will create a new UTXO. To provide the legality verification of UTXO in the process of verifying the block, every full node maintains a local UTXO pool. After verifying the block is legal, the node will update the UTXO pool dynamically based on the transaction information in the block.

​	The form of UTXO in the UTXO pool is a hash, calculated by SHA256 (asset ID + asset amount + contract + SourceID). The asset ID is added to the hash because  Bytom is supposed to support multiple types of asset , but in the kernel design, the asset ID is added to confuse the hash to make multiple types of asset can share one UTXO pool. In the calculation of UTXO , the amount of assets, contract, and asset ID are only used to confuse the hash results,  for that ensures the uniqueness of each UXTO hash depends on the SourceID.  SourceID is a hash of all inputs in a transaction calculated by SHA256 (Input1 UTXO + Input2 UTXO ... + InputN UTXO). From a high-level perspective, the SourceID can represent the historical transfer data of all inputs  in a transaction,and the uniqueness of each SourceID will be guaranteed in this way. The uniqueness of each SoureID guarantees the uniqueness of each UTXO, and the uniqueness of each UTXO also ensures the uniqueness of each SourceID.
